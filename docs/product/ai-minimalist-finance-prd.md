# PRD: clawdi — Your Daily Companion

## 1. Objective

Build an open-source, privacy-first mobile app that helps people take control of the 6 things that actually matter in life — money, time, health, people, mind, and growth — all in one place.

clawdi is not a finance app. Not a habit tracker. Not a planner. It's the one app that holds your whole life together.

## 2. Tagline

- "Your daily companion."
- "Finance is your foundation. Life is your goal."
- "The 6 things that actually matter — in one app."

## 3. Target Audience

- **Everyone who feels their life is scattered** — across 10 different apps and still not feeling on top of it.
- **People who want simplicity** — overwhelmed by feature-heavy apps. Want one place, not ten.
- **All ages, all countries** — multi-currency from day 1. No country-specific features. Globally relevant.
- **Privacy-conscious** — open source, local-first, no cloud sync for personal data.

## 4. The 6 Life Pillars

| Pillar | Icon | Core Question | Tab |
|--------|------|--------------|-----|
| Money | 💰 | Am I financially okay? | Money |
| Time | ⏰ | Am I spending my time well? | Day |
| Health | 🏥 | Am I taking care of my body? | Life |
| People | ❤️ | Am I keeping up with people I love? | People |
| Mind | 🧠 | How am I feeling emotionally? | Life |
| Growth | 🎯 | Am I becoming a better person? | Day |

## 5. User Stories

- **Clarity:** "As a user, I want a single score that tells me how my life is going — across money, health, time, and relationships."
- **Easy Logging:** "As a user, I want to log expenses, moods, and habits in under 10 seconds."
- **Awareness:** "As a user, I want the app to show me connections I can't see — like how my sleep affects my spending."
- **Relationships:** "As a user, I want to know when I'm drifting from people I care about — before it's too late."
- **Privacy:** "As a user, I want all my data stored on my device. No cloud. No selling. No ads."
- **Direction:** "As a user, I want to set 3 priorities each day so my time feels intentional, not random."
- **Progress:** "As a user, I want to see how I've improved over time — not just what I did today."
- **No Setup:** "As a user, I want the app to feel useful from the first second — no empty screens, no 10-minute setup."

## 6. App Architecture

### 5 Tabs + Center Raised Add Button

```
              [+ ADD] ← raised above tab bar, floating
                 |
[🏠 Home] [💰 Money] [🌿 Life] [☀️ Day] [❤️ People]
```

The "+" opens a universal quick-action bottom sheet — context-aware based on time of day.

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Home** | Read-only dashboard — clawdi Score, daily budget, habits ring, Spark challenge, relationship nudge, personalized greeting |
| **Money** | Financial health — expense log, budget per category, savings goals, bill reminders, payday tools |
| **Life** | Health + Mind — mood check-in, habit tracker, sleep log, water, stress, medication, steps |
| **Day** | Time + Growth — top 3 priorities, Pomodoro, planner, quick list, break randomizer |
| **People** | Relationships — contacts, last-talked tracker, birthday reminders, gift ideas, conversation memory |

## 13. Anti-Bloat Rules

- **3-Request Rule** — only build if 3 real users independently asked
- **30-Day Wait** — any idea waits 30 days before building
- **10-Second Rule** — every core action under 10 seconds or it doesn't ship
- **Kill Unused** — remove if <10% of users open after 60 days
- **3-Screen Max** — each tab has max 3 screens
- **Give Before Take** — clawdi gives value before asking for input

## 14. The Golden Rule

> "The best features in clawdi aren't things users DO — they're things clawdi DOES for them."

Logging = the user works. Getting a spending alert = clawdi works.
The more clawdi works, the more indispensable it becomes.
